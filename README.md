# Law Referral Generator
This repo is a chrome extension to find and highlight Israeli lows on any website.

The current version is based on Regex search and works with Hebrew text only. 

When the extension finds a low in your website it will generate a link to the low details in   [The Israeli National Legislative Database](https://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawHome.aspx).

* In your Chrome browser, navigate to chrome://extensions.

* Expand the Developer drop down and click “Load unpacked extension.”

At this point, the extension is installed and running.
