# Law Referral Generator
This repo is a chrome extension to find and highlight Israeli lows on any website.

The current version is based on Regex search and works with Hebrew text only. 

When the extension finds a low in your website it will generate a link to the low details in   [The Israeli National Legislative Database](https://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawHome.aspx).


## Background:
Many website users meet references to laws or sections of law and cannot simply refer to the requested law or the section within it.

### The Mission:
Development of a tool or plugin for a browser that knows how to run an HTML file, identify and capture names of rules and sections that appear on the page, translate them into a URI, and use them to display the current version of the section as it appears in the full XML database.

An example of such a tool can be seen in Safria's referral network for Jewish religious literature. In this project, we want to convert to this task in the field of legislation.

## Installation
